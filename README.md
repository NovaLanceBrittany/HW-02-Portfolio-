# Advanced CSS: Brittany Jungclaus Portfolio

## About Me: Brittany Jungclaus 


This is my first time building a Portfolio on the web! For now this will have sevaral placeholders for some of the projects that I have yet to complete as well as a section for live and completed projects that you can visit on the web. 

I am excited to show you my ideas and if you have any feedback please feel free to post comments on my GitHub page on this repo. 


## Tech Stack

```
Languages Featured: HTML, CSS, JS

## Portfolio Setup

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```


## Mock-Up
